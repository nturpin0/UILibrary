## Getting Started
In order to use any of the functions in the library you will need to send a Dictionary to a Run Shortcut command. In some cases you may also use a Text Action or a List Action in addition to the Dictionary.

Remember to turn off Show while running, this has two reasons it will improve the stability of the Shortcut, and will allow it to run faster.
